# Airbnb Data Analysis (EDA)

## by annahico

## Summary of Project

In this project, I aim to analyze Airbnb listings data to uncover insights about pricing, availability, and key factors that influence rental trends. The dataset provides detailed information on various properties, including location, price, number of reviews, and availability.

There is one notebook dedicated to this project:

1. **Airbnb Data Analysis.ipynb**: This notebook focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Airbnb listings, including data cleaning, visualization, and hypothesis testing to understand patterns in pricing and availability.

My initial assumption is that properties with higher review counts tend to have lower prices due to increased competition. Therefore, our hypotheses are:

**Null Hypothesis:** There is no significant relationship between the number of reviews and the price of Airbnb listings.  
**Alternative Hypothesis:** A higher number of reviews is associated with lower listing prices.

We will assume a Type 1 Error rate of 0.05.
